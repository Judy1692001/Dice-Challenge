Dicee Game is a fun, interactive web-based game where two players roll dice to compete for the highest roll. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project dynamically updates the dice images based on random numbers generated for each player. The game announces the winner after each round or declares a draw if both players roll the same number. The project showcases skills in DOM manipulation, random number generation, and responsive design, with custom styling and fonts to create an engaging user experience.
